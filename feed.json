They're deliberately making the platform experience worse, showing messages like \"Experiencing issues?\" when loading a video. If you click \"Find out more,\" it simply blames ad-blocking extensions, saying something along the lines of:<br data-start=\"416\" data-end=\"419\"><em data-start=\"419\" data-end=\"626\">\"Yeah, these extensions that block ads are the reason why. They were made with evil intentions to ruin your video experience. Just disable them and you'll be happy, without that thing that came from hell.\"</em><br data-start=\"626\" data-end=\"629\">Like, what? They’re literally shaming you for using an adblocker.</p>\n<p data-start=\"696\" data-end=\"1006\"><strong data-start=\"696\" data-end=\"711\">My opinion:</strong> YouTube needs to chill and admit they’re degrading the experience for adblock users on purpose. And let’s be honest, adblockers are great. I bet someone at Google uses one. The internet is practically unusable without one. Go to Dailymail.com with an adblocker turned off, it’s a complete mess.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1008\" data-end=\"1259\">I really wish governments would implement proper ad regulations, making it illegal for websites to intentionally worsen the experience for users who rely on adblockers. I could see the EU doing something like this, though I’m not so sure about the US.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1261\" data-end=\"1303\">And that’s all I have to say about that...</p>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"\" data-start=\"123\" data-end=\"519\">As you probably know, there's a lot of transphobia, homophobia, right-wing rhetoric, and anti-feminism—especially in the United States, but also to some extent in Germany. There's been a lot of talk about the AfD, the Trump administration, and some weird multi-billionaire who just wants to destroy U.S. aid. I like to call them <strong data-start=\"452\" data-end=\"475\">\"The Three Losers.\"</strong> Here are my opinions on these three idiots:</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" data-start=\"526\" data-end=\"533\">AfD</h3>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"535\" data-end=\"1043\">The AfD (<em data-start=\"544\" data-end=\"573\">Alternative für Deutschland</em>, or Alternative for Germany) is a right-wing party that was formed in 2013, and honestly, I don’t think I need to explain much further why they’re bad. They’ve been labeled as “certainly right-wing extremist” by the <em data-start=\"790\" data-end=\"823\">Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz</em> (BfV). They've gained a lot of support in states like Saxony, and even in Thuringia, they've been elected. In the city where I live, the AfD received a lot of votes—though not enough to actually govern the state I’m in.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" data-start=\"1050\" data-end=\"1074\">Trump Administration</h3>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1076\" data-end=\"1593\">Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, and again in 2025. During his time as president of the United <em data-start=\"1182\" data-end=\"1191\">Fucking</em> States of America, he's made decisions that completely confuse me. For example, in 2025, Trump banned transgender military members from serving in the U.S. military, stating there are “only two genders,” which is completely false. Back in 2020, even Krist Novoselic—yes, <strong data-start=\"1463\" data-end=\"1486\">THE Krist Novoselic</strong>—got hate for supporting Trump. I mean, what do you expect from a former bassist being a politician?</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1595\" data-end=\"2055\">Then there are the U.S. tech companies like Google, which reportedly removed Pride Month from Google Maps entirely, and even renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America.” Out of all the issues facing the United States, <em data-start=\"1821\" data-end=\"1827\">this</em> is what they chose to focus on? I think you folks in the U.S. are probably more informed than I am, since I live in Germany and get most of my U.S. news online—so maybe I shouldn't believe everything. But still, it’s messed up.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2057\" data-end=\"2101\">And speaking of messed up… that leads us to:</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" data-start=\"2108\" data-end=\"2141\">Elon Musk (Multi-Billionaire)</h3>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2143\" data-end=\"2449\">Before he bought Twitter and basically did a gesture resembling a Hitler salute, I thought he was a pretty cool guy. He came off as a billionaire who didn’t take himself too seriously. But after diving headfirst into MAGA culture and promoting DOGE, I’ve decided there’s nothing good left to say about him.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2451\" data-end=\"2924\">Not only does he seem to have an administration in the U.S. full of teenagers and unqualified hires, firing actual government employees, but he also wants to dismantle the Department of Education and eliminate U.S. Aid programs. What even goes on in his brain? Why target the Department of Education? Does he want future kids to grow up with nothing but an iPad shoved in their faces and no real education? And why cut U.S. Aid? You don’t want treatment for AIDS or cancer?</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2926\" data-end=\"2964\">Also—<strong data-start=\"2931\" data-end=\"2964\">I WANT THE FUCKING BIRD BACK!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"2966\" data-end=\"3189\">And as for him calling one of his kids, Vivian Jenna Wilson, a victim of the “woke mind virus”—basically calling being transgender a virus—what the hell? Didn’t he literally sign the papers for her transition? Like, <em data-start=\"3182\" data-end=\"3188\">what</em>?</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"3196\" data-end=\"3224\">Yes, the world is cooked. 😭</p>",

I won't get too much into detail, since one of BitView mods made a blog post that you can read here:<br>https://www.bitview.net/blog#169</p>\n<p>I was also confused with all the other BitView people, the chat was going insane, and also the day before, ATreeager's server was raided by trolls and so on.</p>\n<p>Now this may seem like I just mention here for no reason in the middle of this blog, but my brain sometimes makes random sentences that could seem offensive without a second thought, but when confronted or looking back, I may say \"Who is this idiot\" or \"oh shit, here come the consequences\".</p>\n<p>I made a very <strong>BAD </strong>comment about a BitView moderator/maintainer, during a time when messages like \"Bittoco is evil\" and so were sent. I've heard someone from the Bittoco Discord Server was sending the convos from Treeager's server there, and since they posted it there, it was seen as Transphobic. I know I have responsibility for the stuff I say online or offline, and it ended up adding more fuel to the fire, since now the topic of transphobia is now in this situation about grooming and so</p>\n<p>I was banned 30 minutes later from BitView and the Bittoco Discord Server permanently.</p>\n<p>I panicked, it was also around 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. when I started to think of what I was banned for, since Carlbot just N/A, so no ban reason for me.</p>\n<p>Someone said to contact a BitView mod on Discord, which I did. I had a convo with them for 28 minutes, until they ended up saying \"Yeah I'll send it to the staff and see what they think.\"</p>\n<p>I also do want to talk about something, that the BitView mod probably noticed (and the staff if they sent it to them)</p>\n<p>The time that took for me to respond was suspiciously slow as if I was trying to make excuses to get me back to the platform, which has been used many times with bad people. I asked myself, things like \"Why did you write this\", \"What was your motive\" and other stuff, and it takes way too much time to actually get an answer if you are asking yourself. Some people may relate. But another reason why it took so slowly is because I was tired as hell and I needed to complete to talk to the BitView staff before going to bed</p>\n<p>If any BitView staff is reading this to the end, great! You have heard my side of the story, but I do have another thing: If I make a stupid comment, say something stupid, or just begin in a bad day, someone, that is either a BitView staff or so, could ask me \"Hey MrHalfLife, are you good?\" or \"Hey MrHalfLife, what did you mean with that comment?\" etc. I may say \"I am in a bad day\" or I may say the word \"Brainmesser\" which means in this context \"Yeah, I made a statement without second thoughts.\" which could be really good.<br><br>So, I'm sorry for anyone who got offended. I am just some 13 year old who just didn't think before sending a message.</p>\n<p>And that's all I have to say about that...<br><br><strong>EDIT (16.03.2025)</strong>: BitView changed their age requirement from 13 to 14+, and since I am turning 14 this year, on the 8th of December, I may come back. However I am not sure if the Bittoco people or BitView people would read this</p>",
