They recently banned the 22-year-old YouTuber Schlep because he was catching predators on Roblox. He got six arrested.</p><p data-start="322" data-end="944">Matt Kaufman, the Chief “Safety” Officer at Roblox, calls Schlep and his team a “vigilante group.” Kaufman… do you know what you are talking about? Vigilante means, in simple English, an average Joe or organization acting in a law enforcement capacity (or in the pursuit of self-perceived justice) without legal authority, like the police. <strong>SCHLEP DIDN’T DO VIGILANTE SHIT!</strong> Schlep reached out to law enforcement with the same Google Drive that he gave to Roblox’s scuffed support ticket system, and law enforcement is actively thanking Schlep and his team for showing proof. Honestly, Matt Kaufman, go back to law school.</p><p data-start="946" data-end="1588">Now, what did Roblox do to Schlep? Well, they terminated all of his Roblox accounts that he made since he was 8 years old, including his family-friendly Roblox account “maliboomer,” which I think had a shit ton of Robux. Deleted. Roblox sent him a cease and desist to his P.O. Box and an email basically saying “you can’t use Roblox.” What was Roblox smoking? A cease and desist is basically a letter telling someone to stop doing something that might be illegal or harmful. Schlep didn’t do anything illegal or harmful. In fact, the six predators that Schlep exposed should get a cease and desist since they actually did something illegal.</p><p data-start="1590" data-end="1639">Now the response from the community is <strong>INSANE!!</strong></p><p data-start="1641" data-end="2382">Roblox YouTubers are considering leaving the Star Program. Developers are planning #FreeSchlep chants at RDC 2025, which will happen in less than a month. People are making massive game servers for Schlep. Funerals, tributes, whatever. In fact, the hellhole of the internet, Twitter, has finally caught wind of this situation. A lot of MAGA accounts have suddenly been posting about Schlep, even DramaAlert. You know you’re cooked when DramaAlert makes a tweet about your company. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>ASMONGOLD TALKED ABOUT IT!!</strong></em></span> Even XQC and MoistCr1TiKaL. Louisiana’s attorney general is suing Roblox because of child safety worries. Even Qatar banned Roblox. And Indonesia too, although they banned Roblox because they think Roblox has harmful content for youth or something.</p><p data-start="2384" data-end="2438">David Roblox, you know you are cooked at this point.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 15, 2025</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://mrhalflife280.github.io/HalfBlog/the-internet-is-replacing-parents.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  The internet is replacing parents.
