There's been a lot of talk about the AfD, the Trump administration, and some weird multi-billionaire who just wants to destroy U.S. aid. I like to call them <strong data-start="452" data-end="475">"The Three Losers."</strong> Here are my opinions on these three idiots:</p><h3 data-start="526" data-end="533">AfD</h3><p data-start="535" data-end="1043">The AfD (<em data-start="544" data-end="573">Alternative f√ºr Deutschland</em>, or Alternative for Germany) is a right-wing party that was formed in 2013, and honestly, I don‚Äôt think I need to explain much further why they‚Äôre bad. They‚Äôve been labeled as ‚Äúcertainly right-wing extremist‚Äù by the <em data-start="790" data-end="823">Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz</em> (BfV). They've gained a lot of support in states like Saxony, and even in Thuringia, they've been elected. In the city where I live, the AfD received a lot of votes‚Äîthough not enough to actually govern the state I‚Äôm in.</p><h3 data-start="1050" data-end="1074">Trump Administration</h3><p data-start="1076" data-end="1593">Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, and again in 2025. During his time as president of the United <em data-start="1182" data-end="1191">Fucking</em> States of America, he's made decisions that completely confuse me. For example, in 2025, Trump banned transgender military members from serving in the U.S. military, stating there are ‚Äúonly two genders,‚Äù which is completely false. Back in 2020, even Krist Novoselic‚Äîyes, <strong data-start="1463" data-end="1486">THE Krist Novoselic</strong>‚Äîgot hate for supporting Trump. I mean, what do you expect from a former bassist being a politician?</p><p data-start="1595" data-end="2055">Then there are the U.S. tech companies like Google, which reportedly removed Pride Month from Google Maps entirely, and even renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the ‚ÄúGulf of America.‚Äù Out of all the issues facing the United States, <em data-start="1821" data-end="1827">this</em> is what they chose to focus on? I think you folks in the U.S. are probably more informed than I am, since I live in Germany and get most of my U.S. news online‚Äîso maybe I shouldn't believe everything. But still, it‚Äôs messed up.</p><p data-start="2057" data-end="2101">And speaking of messed up‚Ä¶ that leads us to:</p><h3 data-start="2108" data-end="2141">Elon Musk (Multi-Billionaire)</h3><p data-start="2143" data-end="2449">Before he bought Twitter and basically did a gesture resembling a Hitler salute, I thought he was a pretty cool guy. He came off as a billionaire who didn‚Äôt take himself too seriously. But after diving headfirst into MAGA culture and promoting DOGE, I‚Äôve decided there‚Äôs nothing good left to say about him.</p><p data-start="2451" data-end="2924">Not only does he seem to have an administration in the U.S. full of teenagers and unqualified hires, firing actual government employees, but he also wants to dismantle the Department of Education and eliminate U.S. Aid programs. What even goes on in his brain? Why target the Department of Education? Does he want future kids to grow up with nothing but an iPad shoved in their faces and no real education? And why cut U.S. Aid? You don‚Äôt want treatment for AIDS or cancer?</p><p data-start="2926" data-end="2964">Also‚Äî<strong data-start="2931" data-end="2964">I WANT THE FUCKING BIRD BACK!</strong></p><p data-start="2966" data-end="3189">And as for him calling one of his kids, Vivian Jenna Wilson, a victim of the ‚Äúwoke mind virus‚Äù‚Äîbasically calling being transgender a virus‚Äîwhat the hell? Didn‚Äôt he literally sign the papers for her transition? Like, <em data-start="3182" data-end="3188">what</em>?</p><p data-start="3196" data-end="3224">Yes, the world is cooked. üò≠</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 15, 2025</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://mrhalflife280.github.io/HalfBlog/quick-rant-about-italian-brainrot.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Quick rant about italian brainrot "><span class="btn__icon">‚Üê</span> <span class="btn__text">Quick rant about italian brainrot</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>¬© 2025 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://mrhalflife280.github.io/HalfBlog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=c2232aa7558e9517946129d2a1b8c770"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
