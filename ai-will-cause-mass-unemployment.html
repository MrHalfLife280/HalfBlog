Which puts teachers, people who have studied one or two subjects for almost their entire lifes, just to be replaced by AI</li><li>Musicians: There are programs, that let you create beats or even entire songs using AI. And as an artist, I am very offended.</li><li>Banking Systems: This kind of goes into the first one, but they will use more AI for banking stuff</li><li>Writing: There could be an episode of a show written entirely by AI, only if the AI knows what happened in the season, or who the characters are with their backstories.</li><li>Cashiers: I can see how there won't be any human cashiers, just all AI. At Kaufland, where they have scanners, and if you buy something from the bakery, you go to these weird PC things to scan them without any humans.</li><li>Meme Making: Take Italian Brainrot for example, the audio and the picture was made by AI, and it will effect Gen Alpha as a whole</li><li>YouTube Videos/Streamers/Filmmaking/Animations: Google showed off their Veo 3 or something, that makes real ass footage. Not only Fortnite gameplay, but Streamers</li><li>Artist: AI art is just miserable. On Discord, there was this bot added, called Domo AI, that steals art from a channel for arts, to train a model.</li></ul><p>Here's the image:</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mrhalflife280.github.io/HalfBlog/media/posts/9/Unemployment-V1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://mrhalflife280.github.io/HalfBlog/media/posts/9/responsive/Unemployment-V1-xs.jpg 300w, https://mrhalflife280.github.io/HalfBlog/media/posts/9/responsive/Unemployment-V1-sm.jpg 480w, https://mrhalflife280.github.io/HalfBlog/media/posts/9/responsive/Unemployment-V1-md.jpg 768w, https://mrhalflife280.github.io/HalfBlog/media/posts/9/responsive/Unemployment-V1-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 3, 2025</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://mrhalflife280.github.io/HalfBlog/when-losers-have-lost-their-minds-bigots.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  When losers have lost their minds (Bigots) "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">When losers have lost their minds (Bigots)</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2025 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://mrhalflife280.github.io/HalfBlog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=c2232aa7558e9517946129d2a1b8c770"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
